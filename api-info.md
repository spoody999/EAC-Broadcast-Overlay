Rocket League Stats API
This document outlines capabilities of the Rocket League Game Data API. First, players must ask the game to enable this feature by editing their DefaultStatsAPI.ini, explained below. Once active, this feature will open a web socket on the player's machine that emits gameplay data and events. Third party programs can ingest this data to power a variety of applications, such as custom broadcaster HUDs.
Overview
The Stats API broadcasts JSON messages over a local socket while a match is in progress. Messages are sent both at a configurable periodic rate and when specific match events occur. Event data is always emitted on the same tick that the event occurs, regardless of the user's PacketSendRate.
Note: All configuration must be done before the client starts — changes to the ini while the client is running require a restart.
Field visibility:
Fields marked CONDITIONAL are only present when relevant.
Fields marked SPECTATOR are only present if the client is spectating or on the player's team.
Configuration
Edit <Install Dir>\TAGame\Config\DefaultStatsAPI.ini before launching the client.
